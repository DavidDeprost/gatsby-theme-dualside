# gatsby-theme-dualside
This theme attempts to provide a generic, re-usable and modular layout for developing
Single Page Progressive Web Applications with responsive sidebars on the left and right.

Current focus is on:
- Having a single codebase that works optimally on both desktop and mobile.
- Responsive design: should work on any viewport size.
- Touch-friendly: the sidebars should respond to swiping.
- On mobile, the PWA should deliver an experience comparable to native apps.
- In a later stage, we might want to enable the sidebars to be *user-resizable*.

**WIP!**
